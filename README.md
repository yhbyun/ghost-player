A transparent, floating desktop video player for multitasking. GhostPlayer lets you watch videos from various streaming services or local files in a resizable, semi-transparent window that always stays on top, allowing you to work or browse while you watch.

## About The Project

In a world of multitasking, switching between windows is a constant hassle. GhostPlayer solves this by providing a seamless, "ghost-like" video player that floats over your other applications. It's designed for power users, avid learners, and anyone who wants to keep an eye on a video, stream, or tutorial without sacrificing screen real estate.

Whether you're following a coding tutorial, watching a live stream, or just enjoying a movie while you work, GhostPlayer is your perfect companion.

## Features

- **Floating Window**: The player window floats on top of all other applications.
- **Adjustable Transparency**: Fine-tune the opacity from 10% to 100%. Set transparency to be always on, or have it dynamically change on mouse-over or mouse-out.
- **Multi-Service Support**: Easily switch between streaming services like YouTube and Netflix.
- **Local File Playback**: Open and watch local video files directly (`.mp4`, `.webm`, etc.).
- **Side Dock Mode**: Dock the player to the side of your screen. It will peek out, and you can fully reveal it by hovering over it.
- **Click-Through Mode**: Make the player window non-interactive, allowing you to click through it to the applications underneath.
- **Custom Shortcuts**: Configure global shortcuts to control the player without leaving your current window.
- **Cross-Platform**: Available for Windows, macOS, and Linux.
